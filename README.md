# PineapplePOS üçç

PineapplePOS is a simple and easy-to-use inventory management software designed for small shops and sales. Instead of relying on barcode scanning, it uses a grid-based interface to select products, making it a good choice for shops with a smaller range of products while not requiring specalized barcode scanning hardware.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Select products from a grid without needing specialized hardware like a barcode scanner.
- **Flexible User Roles**: Supports four distinct roles with tailored privileges.
- **Stock Management**: Add, edit, and remove products with attributes like name, amount in stock, price, category, and more.
- **Sales Tracking**: Perform sales with a simple and intuitive interface and stay on top of your inventory.
